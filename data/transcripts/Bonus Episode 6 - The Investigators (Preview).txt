 Hi, I’m Joseph Fink. What you’re
about to hear are two clips from our last touring live show, The
Investigators, which is now available, right now, for sale at


,
and will be available on iTunes soon (or it might be already,
depending on when you’re listening to this). This is over two hours
of brand new Night Vale with live music and a ton of guest stars,
plus ten bonus tracks of guest stars that we couldn’t fit into the
main recording. So, even if you saw this show live, there is a ton of
stuff in here you have never heard. Also available on Bandcamp and
iTunes, our previous four live recordings and the Welcome to Night
Vale audio book. Check those out. And we will see you with our brand
new live script Ghost Stories in the U.S. in July, and in Europe in
October. I can’t wait. Enjoy.

And
now an update on last week’s power outages. The Night Vale Electric
Utility announced today that there may be more power outages in
coming weeks. This time, due to sadness.

“We’ve
just been sad this week,” the Electric Utility said. “Not for any
reason, just…sometimes we get sad. What do we need a reason for?
Last week we were feeling vengeful, so…power outages. This week
we’re feeling sad, and we’re going to continue expressing ourselves
through the medium of power outages.”

Now,
power outages were, of course, certified by the Supreme Court as a
protected form of free speech in the 1973 case of the Hayworth
Electric Company vs the Hayworth Hospital. And the court stated that
reasonable causes for a power outage include celebration of a special
someone’s birthday, expression of undirected anger at an intransigent
political system, and periods of just feeling sad for no reason.

But
the Night Vale Electric Utility would like me to remind you that
power outages are no excuse not to pay your electric bill. I mean,
electricity is, after all, a privilege, not a right. Failure to pay
your electric bill may result in localized lightning storms, shrouded
figures standing silently in the back of familiar TV shows, and gout.
So…

So.
A spokesperson from the Sheriff’s Secret Police has
just handed me a note explaining that I am not required to attend the
murder mystery dinner theater, as I was here in my booth broadcasting
during the time of the murder.


Oh. Um, they just handed me another note, but it reads, “We don’t
know where that scientist is. Please let the scientist know he is
required to attend.”


Now, look. Carlos has been busy all day in his science
lab…science-ing. If, 

 he were even able to leave the lab,
he would certainly not just murder a stranger…without stopping by
the radio station to say hello to me first!


I’m gonna call Carlos right now.


Hey, you! I was just thinking of you.


Hi, I’m so sorry to bother you, but I’ve received some bad news from
the Secret Police.


Ugh. I knew this would eventually happen. They discovered that my
team of scientists is studying geology, right? I know, I know, it’s
illegal. And, as Francis Scott Key wrote in his famous poem, “Rocks
are just rocks! Mind your own business, pal!” But I find geology so
scientifically interesting, I cannot 


that they just– 



No no no, it’s not that. It’s…there’s been a murder, and the
Sheriff’s Secret Police need you to attend the mandatory murder
mystery dinner theater.


Oh. But that is great news! Um, I love dinner theaters. I, um, I took
some theater in college, you know, so I can play, like, a bunch of
different roles.


Oh, really?


Yeah, okay. So the part that 


wants to play in a murder mystery dinner theater, you know who it is?
It’s the butler.


Oh.


Because the butler gets to wear pastel tuxedos and carry this pet
rat. Ooh! And I can do, like, a 


really good snooty British accent. Ahem.

 “'Ey! I would never
murder anyone! Might I perhaps take your coat, sir?”


I don’t know if that’s really a 


accent.


Babe, it is.


Oh, is it?


Yeah. Mm-hmm.


Okay. All right.


So, like, another great role in the murder mystery dinner theater is
the rich heiress. Ah! The rich heiress! Um, okay. She gets to wear
this like tight black dress, and pearls, and a feathered boa (which
you know look amazing in).


I do.


I do. So, the rich heiress, of course, she 


like the murderer, because she always carries around this old
bloodstained axe, but that’s the thing! She only carries the ax
because her mother was the owner of the world’s biggest axe
manufacturing conglomerate, and their family made a great fortune by
chopping up people and taking all their money. Anyway, the rich
heiress has this glorious and smooth Romanian accent.


Please know that I would never murder anyone. Now go get me another
drink doll. Chop chop! I’m kidding. 


Ohhhh! Now, I’ve never been to Romania…


Babe, it’s a dead-on accent.


Oh, okay. All right. Now, listen, Carlos, I’m actually really
surprised to hear this side of you. I mean, I had no idea that you
were such a theater nerd!


Yeah! Like, I’m a scientist, sure, but that’s not 


I am, you know?


Yeah?


Like, getting to act in a murder mystery dinner theater would give me
the chance to be…


a scientist anymore, you know? Like, um, like, like I could be
anyone! Like…like a train conductor, and I’d shout “All aboard!”
Um, or a pizza maker, and I would shout, “All aboard, and it’s a
pizza!” Um, or, I don’t know, like, oh! Like a writer! And I’d
shout “I am alone, so terribly alone!”


Carlos, I– I think the idea is that everybody is just themselves,
so that way the police can easily scan the crowd and find out who
looks the most guilty. I mean, I don’t think that murder mystery
dinner theater is ever supposed to be 

!
They are grueling exercises in abrupt and arbitrary justice.


You know who I want to play? I want to play a librarian.


Oh, I don’t think that’s a very– 



“You seem to be very interested in young adult sci-fi adventure
novels. Might I recommend 

 by


?”

Whoo!
That felt really good.


It sounded good.


Thank you. But I would really, really need to work with the director,
you know, on how to get the pincers and all the long hairy legs just
right. Ooh! Ooh! And we would 


need to rig up a pulley system so that I could fly around the room
and then descend from the ceiling like a normal librarian.


Oh! Um, Carlos, I was just handed another not from the Secret Police
that reads: “No more, please! Tell him he doesn’t have to come to
the dinner theater at all!”


…But I wanted to come.


Aww.


Um, eh, it’s no bother.


Well, we will just have to put on our own murder mystery dinner
theater this weekend.


Okay. Um, I love you.


All right. I love you too.


Ooh! Ooh! You want to hear my Steve Carlsberg impression?


Goodbye, Carlos.


Okie-doke.
