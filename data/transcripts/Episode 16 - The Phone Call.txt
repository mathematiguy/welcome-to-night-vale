Your existence is not impossible, but it’s also not very likely.

Welcome to Night Vale. 

In light of the ever-declining sales of newspapers, and the rise of competition from digital media, the Night Vale Daily Journal announced that it has developed a new business model. Publishing editor Leann Hart, speaking to television and internet reporters outside the burned-down shell of the Journal’s former distribution plant, said their 

 mission, as a newspaper, is to 

 news bloggers with hatchets.

In this bold new initiative – a game-changing strategy by one of the industry stalwarts – the Daily Journal plans to just go to bloggers’ homes and places of employment (with hatchets) and then chop them up (the bloggers) until they (the bloggers) are dead.

She added that the Journal still plans to use the AP Style Guide and they are working to design a newer, more modern-looking masthead.

Several Journal reporters and ad reps then began swinging blades at the non-print reporters in attendance.

The Sheriff’s Secret Police is issuing an urgent message to all citizens:

Memorize this list. Memorize it now. It will not now, 

, be repeated. Memorize this list for your safety and protection. We cannot tell you when or where you will need to know it but when you do, you will be safe. Here is the list.

Memorize. 

Memorize that list, citizens, in order.

Secret Police warn that if you miss even 

 word, or transpose a couple of worlds like “lurk” and “lark,” there could be unpleasant consequences.

This has been a special announcement from the Sheriff’s Secret Police.

Listeners, guess who called me this weekend. Well, hey, I don’t like to talk too much about my personal life here. This is 

 community news station, not 

, right?

Okay, fine. I’ll just say it:

Carlos, the dark, delicate-skinned scientist who came into our little town and our littler hearts several months ago.

Well, I gave him my home phone number quite a while back, and he never called, and I didn’t think anything of it, right? I mean, sometimes people just 

, and that’s okay. Well, to the point:

Carlos calls, and I’m like, “Hello?” Like I don’t even have caller ID!

And he’s like “I need to talk to you. This is important.”

And I’m like, “Umm, OK.”

I mean, that’s pretty 

, right, listeners? But I can’t tell exactly what he wants yet.

And he said “Cecil.”

Just the 

 of his caramel voice!

“

,” he says. 

And then I said, after a slow sip of Armagnac, “Oh?”

And perfect Carlos said, “Last week: seven days, 24 hours each day, 60 minutes in each hour. That’s 10,080 minutes in a week, right?”

“Uh huh? Go on…” I said, trying to sound like someone with a normal pulse whose palms were 

 sweating.

“Well, I ran some figures, and during that same amount of time in Night Vale, 11,783 minutes elapsed everywhere else in the world. That’s more than a full day longer. I don’t know what’s happening.”

So that’s what Carlos said! Listeners, what do you think? I feel like time always slows down when we’re together, Carlos and I. Is 

 what he’s trying to say? I feel that way too!

But I didn’t say it, I just said, ohh, this is bad…I just said, 

Ugh! How embarrassing!

I mean, Carlos is 

 smart, and he says 

 many smart things! And I’m not dumb! I like science and municipally-approved books just as much as the next guy, so I can’t 

 that’s all I could say to him.

But…I did manage to ask if he wanted to get together sometime, and talk some more about this really fascinating subject. He said no…but he 

 me to help get the word out and see if anyone has noticed a massive time-shift, so that’s what I’m doing now. Anything for the scientific community; I’m very into science these days!  

Wow! Can you believe he called 

?  

Update on the impending invasion from the underground city:

The Sheriff’s Secret Police has reviewed Teddy Williams’ grainy security footage from the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex, and they say that the nearly-indiscernible grey blotch making a slight movement near the cheese dispenser 

 that a lost city is moving toward war with Night Vale.

A balaclava-clad man wearing a mitre, cloak, and a giant silver star, and speaking through a vocoder – you know, the man we all believe to be the Sheriff of Night Vale? – announced this morning that all citizens should prepare their town for war.

This includes: f

We talked with Teddy himself. He told us that during last night’s league bowling tournament, the jukebox malfunctioned and would not stop playing “Mister Brownstone.” Teddy says this 

 be a code, some kind of threatening message, or maybe even a subtle call for peace.

He also asked that Night Vale citizens learn their shoe sizes. Shoe rentals are taking way too long, and it’s really not that hard to memorize a one or two-digit number.

The Sheriff’s Secret Police also asks Night Vale residents to please help in their neighborhood watch program. Secret Police are in 

 neighborhood, watching 

, so here are some tips on how you can help this invaluable community surveillance program.  

And as always, if you see something, say “something.” That’s the code word to call a special raid on a neighbor or stranger.

Now, in the news. After several months of protests from ordinary Night Vale citizens of stout and sturdy character, the City Council has announced several improvements for the Public Library. These improvements are the following:

An entrance is being constructed at the front of the building, so we will no longer have to enter by waking up between two shelves in a dizzy haze, unsure of how we got there, and then wandering around, trapped, until we wake with a start in our own beds, covered with sweat, and with a few books we checked out on our nightstand.

Drinking fountains are being installed in the lobby, as well as dunking chambers, and a state-of-the-art fainting pool.

Librarian repellent dispensers are being placed throughout the building. Remember, if approached by a librarian, keep still. 

. Try to make yourself 

 than the librarian.

Finally, the children’s section is getting beanbag chairs.

That is all.

Yes!

Yes.

And now, traffic.

All roads lead to somewhere, and all roads come 

 somewhere. And in between they are a snarl and curve, a twist and a bend. Where are we going? I mean, metaphorically? Where are we coming from? I mean, literally. Is it possible to stop, or turn around, and if not, what does that mean for the latest polls and economic reports?

Ladies and gentlemen: ladies and gentlemen, Route 800 is looking clear in both directions. The old dirt road to the small wooden shack is backed up at least thirty minutes.

There. Now you know. Has that filled an emptiness for you? Are you any happier now? I hope so.

This has been, and will 

 be, traffic.  

Listeners, I can hardly stand it any longer! During the past few stories, my phone has been silently buzzing. You guessed who!

Given that I am a radio host and it is therefore my duty to read you the news, it would be 

 inappropriate for me to answer my phone – regardless of how much I want to soak my ears in the oaky tones of our community’s most significant outsider. But…well…he left me some voice mails. This may be a bit unorthodox, but I need your help, dear listeners, to determine where Carlos is going with all of this. Let’s listen to these together, okay? What do you think he’s trying to say?

Cecil, sorry to bother you. I need you to get the word out that clocks in Night Vale are 

. I have not found a single real clock. I have disassembled several watches and clocks this week and all of them are hollow inside. No gears, no crystal, no battery or power source. Some of them actually contain a gelatinous gray lump that seems to be growing hair…and teeth. I need to know if all clocks are this way, Cecil. This is ver–

standing

Sorry about that, Cecil. I forget what I was doing. I think somebody came over…but I don’t remember who or what for.

Anyway, I need to meet you. Are you free tomorrow afternoon? You have a contact number for the mayor and someone with the police, right? It’s important that I find them. And again, can you get the word out on your radio show about the clocks?

Did you hear that, listeners? A 

 Let’s go to the weather!

Well, I just got off the phone with Carlos, listeners, and

 Tomorrow afternoon! It’s just coffee, but maybe it’s more! Maybe 

 more. Who knows?

You know, they always say if you’re trying to meet someone, you may never find them, but it’s when you’re 

 looking, 

 when they find 

. I’ve always heard this in reference to government agents, but I think it applies to dating as well.

Carlos 

 want me to ask if anyone has ever actually 

 the Night Vale Clock Tower. I told him that it was invisible, and always teleporting, and that’s why he can’t ever see it. I mean, that seems sort of 

.

Okay. That was unfair. Carlos is a very smart man, and I shouldn’t roll my eyes just because he doesn’t comprehend 

. He obviously has a lot of other intriguing interests, though…like clock making, and seismology. And who knows what else?

Oh happy day, listeners! Thanks for listening, and for helping me through this. I’m so very excited!

Before we go, intern Stacy just handed me this:

The Sheriff’s Secret Police would like to issue a 

 to their earlier special alert. In their warning, they stated that memorizing a very specific list would keep you safe. This is incorrect. According to the 

 statement, quote:

End quote.

That’s it for our news. Stay tuned next for a community-wide frisson of cosmic fright. Thank you again, Night Vale! May you, too, find love in this dark desert. May it be as permanent as the blinking lights, and as comforting as the dull roar of space.

Goodnight, Night Vale.
