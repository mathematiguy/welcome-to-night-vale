There’s nothing
under your bed. Nothing in your closet. Nothing waiting in the hall.
You are surrounded by nothing. You cannot escape it.

Welcome to Night
Vale.

I have received
several urgent Facebook messages and Twitter DMs from a Vague, Yet
Menacing, Government Agency, asking me to deliver the following
message:

They said that there
was nothing secret or important about the message, and it was
certainly not related to any ongoing deep undercover operations, that
they can only communicate with using code words subtly buried in
local radio broadcasts.

“It wasn’t
anything crazy like that,” they just think it would be “cool”
to hear me say:

“Do your deepest,
smoothest voice,” they said. “Really sell it. Really give it your
all. It would make us 


happy! Please, it’s our birthday! Oh! Did we not mention it’s 


our birthday? All right, in your best voice, say it.”

Well,
there you go, Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency! Happy birthday!

The
Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, and Hiram
McDaniels, who is literally a five-headed dragon – both former
candidates for the mayoral role now filled by Dana Cardinal – were
seen muttering together in a booth at the Moonlite All-Nite Diner.

Or, Hiram was seen. No one has ever actually seen the Faceless Old
Woman, but we 


know that she is there.

When
reached for comment, by a nosy person sitting in the booth next to
them, Hiram explained that they were just chatting, and were not
involved in any sort of plans or schemes at all. He then held a
conversation with himself about this matter, each head providing a
different viewpoint in five different voices, the gist of which was
that no, they were not planning anything.

“Definitely
not,” the Faceless Old Woman scratched with what seemed to be a
long, jagged fingernail into the sole of my shoe this morning.
“That’s ludicrous,” she suggested, with a flickering shadow in
the corner of my eye as I walked to work. “We would 

,”
she whispered from behind me, just now.

Moving
on, another installment of what I imagine is our listeners’ favorite
segment: Cooking Stuff with Earl Harlan.

As
the name implies, we have my childhood friend and current sous chef
at Night Vale’s hottest restaurant, Tourniquet, with us here in the
studio. Earl?


That’s me, yes.


Well, Earl, just a few months ago you shows us how to cook tiramisu.
And that was delightful.


Oh, please don’t cook that recipe. It is extraordinarily poisonous.


Ha-ha-ha! Oh, Earl. You’re very funny.


It will 

 you,
Cecil. It is 


poisonous. Don’t cook that.


So, tell our listeners (and me, of course) what you’ve been up to
since we last spoke.


Oh, mostly, um, I’ve been working. Mostly living. I’ve been spending
time with my son. Trying to remember when I had a son. I’ve been
trying to understand the flow of my life, and how I don’t remember
going from being 19 to the middle-aged adult I am now. I was 19 for


!


Well, sure! That sounds like fun. I’ll tell you, lately I’ve been
getting into crosswords. Just can’t stop doing them. Doesn’t even
feel like it’s 

 doing them, like it’s someone else 


me to do them. Sometimes I pick up a crossword I’ve never seen
before, only to find it’s been completely filled in with my own
handwriting.

Ha
– well, I’m glad we’ve both been up to such fun things.


Cecil, think. What year were you born?


So, what are we cooking up today, Earl?


Oh, OK. Well, today we are making pulled pork.


Oooh, that sounds yummy!


It is! Pulled pork could not be simpler to make. To start off with,
you will need to kill a pig. You will need to find a living pig, and
kill that pig. You will probably need to hold down the pig. The pig
will struggle. There will be blood, and pain. Some of that pain will
be physical. The pig will want to live, but you will need to make it
die. That pig will need to die.


Sure.


Then, you will need to dismember the pig. The pig will be a whole
being, but you will not be able to eat it like that. So you will need
to take it apart. There will be knives, and hacking. The skin will
have to go. Peel back that skin and take the muscles and subcutaneous
fat which is the part you will consume. Leave the bones and skin
behind to rot.


Mmmmmmmm!


Then…you slow-cook it with some vinegar, some sugar, and some chili.
Put it on a bun, and there ya go! Pulled pork!


Oh, I just can’t wait to try that. It seems so easy! I’ll just use
one of the pigs I have at home.


I’m sorry if I seem down at all, Cecil. I’ve been going through a
lot.


Oh. Well, I understand. This has been a difficult time for me too.
Carlos is away, and…we talk regularly, but it’s not the same as the
physical presence of someone you love, you know?


I know. I know. But that’s what we do when we have someone special
enough to merit special effort. I’m proud of you for working through
this.


And I’m proud of you for dealing with how weird time is. Oh! And for
raising a son…somehow. Uh, what is your son’s name?


I…… I wish I knew.


Well…it’s been great catching up, we’ll see you again soon, Earl!

I
received another flurry of messages from a Vague, Yet Menacing,
Government Agency, saying that…well, “thanks for saying those
words for us, that was great of you, but it looks like maybe it
didn’t work.”

“What
didn’t work?” they rhetorically asked. “Not important,” they
replied to themselves.

“As
we said, that was certainly 


a code word for an undercover agent, who apparently wasn’t listening
to the radio when they were supposed to be, which is (by the way)
their 

 job, and
their duty, and their life’s mission to be listening to instructions
from headquarters, so…no biggie. But maybe, just do something as
simple as listen to the radio at the time we tell you to.”

“Anyway,
none of that is important,” the Agency continued, “and there is
no particular reason we’re asking you, but…could you say “BRINY
DEPTHS” again? It’s for a friend’s birthday. It’s also our friend’s
birthday, we forgot to mention that. Please say it again.”

So…OK.
Here goes.

Happy
birthday to your friend! I hope you enjoyed that, but…I really
can’t keep interrupting my broadcast with this stuff.

Little
League coach Betty Lucero is reporting that there are strange
goings-on near the haunted baseball diamond her team uses for
practices and league games. “No, no no, no, I 

,
it’s haunted,” she said. “I get 

.
You don’t have to explain 


to me. I’m saying that there is 


weird stuff going on beside the usual ghosts.”

She
went on to describe anguished howls coming from a neighborhood
nearby, and a red glow at night that made her skin feel loose and
itchy when she looked directly at it. She also said that the baseball
diamond has started to smell of rotten eggs, which is a detriment to
her team’s performance.

As
we spoke, an apparition of a gray-skinned young woman in a tattered
dress appeared hovering on the baseline between second and third. I



have yelped a little…maybe scrambled backwards a bit, but Coach
Lucero laughed and said, “Oh, that’s just Lucia, our third base
coach. She died in 1843. Say hi, Lucia!”

The
young woman flickered out of view, then reappeared suddenly inches
from my face, her pupil-less eyes staring directly into mine. I
responded in a professional and calm manner, and Coach Lucero laughed
for unrelated reasons, not anything to do with how I may have
reacted, and said, “That’s our Lucia!”

She
then went on to say that she had a bad feeling about the weird
goings-on near the baseball field, and she probably said some other
things, but I was running away, so I didn’t hear her super well.

Oh,
listeners! This is exciting. I received mail today! I didn’t think
mail was still being delivered – not after what happened at the
Post Office – but here it is! An envelope addressed to one Cecil
Palmer in neat handwriting, with the address of the station right
underneath. If 


want to send us any mail, since apparently that is a thing which
exists and is working now, our address is

Night
Vale, 


Please
do send stuff in. It’s always nice to hear from fans.

But,
back to this envelope. Maybe this is silly, but I waited to open it
until I was on the air. It seemed more fun if we could find out
together what was inside. I’m, um, I’m opening it now…

And
here we go. It’s…oh.

Huh.

It’s
a greeting card! It says, “Thanks so much” on the front, and it
has a picture of a cat playing with a ball of yarn, well that’s just
the cutest! Although, I can’t imagine why someone sent me this card.
I’m…I’m opening it…

Oh!
Oh… oh. A photo fell out. Oh…dang it! It fell behind the desk.
Um, the inside of the card just has the words “Thank you for what
you did” printed, and then it’s signed “Erika,” over and over
in multiple handwritings. Huh. Let me…let me try to grab that
photo.

Ummmmm,
I’m going to have to crawl under the desk. While I do that, here’s a
word from our sponsors.

Today’s’
broadcast is sponsored by Kobe beef.

All
right, listeners, I got the photo. And it’s…it’s a photo of…

,
at City Hall…I’m fighting off a pack of antiques in front of the
mayor’s door, but…that wasn’t me! Intern Hector did that, last
month. He came back with that bite? I don’t remember ever leaving my
desk when the antiques attacked our mayor. What…what is this photo?
It must be fake.

It
doesn’t 


fake.

No.
It must be fake. Right? Why would I not remember saving the mayor?

More
on this later, as I face my fragile self and try to understand my own
reality.

OK,
now. This is getting out of hand. The Vague, Yet Menacing, Government
Agency sent me a Snapchat and several anonymous asks on Tumblr,
saying that they were happy about me doing that whole “broadcasting
their secret codeword” thing before, but that the message didn’t
seem to be getting through.

Or,
it’s not a 

,
that was poor phrasing on their part, sorry, they’re just flustered
talking to their favorite radio host.

Awwww!

They


 to say that they haven’t had the best birthday ever yet. And
neither has their friend. Plus, they forgot to mention, millions and
millions of people have the same birthday as them, think of how many
people have their birthday today and 

,
the Agency is sure, “just want 


to say that 


thing again. Just once more, in your smoothest, deepest voice.”

They
say that they’ve made it so our station is currently broadcasting on
every single radio frequency, so no one could possibly miss these
special birthday greetings, and it will 


be the “best birthday ever.”

This
is the last time. OK? I’m doing it just once more, here I go. And
really try to enjoy this, because I am 


doing it again.

Oh.

Whats’
going on? There’s shouting coming from the break room it’s, uh…it
sounds like a scuffle, and…

There’s
also shouting coming from outside. Uhh, a lot of shouting.

A
roar of voices, the stomping feet of a crowd.

These
birthday greetings were apparently very special. I need to go see
what this commotion is about.

I’ll
be back soon. In the meantime, those with birthdays and those who
were never born, I take you to the weather.

[“

Whoo!
I’ll tell you! That was quite a scene.

I



tell you, right now.

It
seems that “BRINY DEPTHS” was, in fact, a code word (wish they
had warned me about that) for an undercover agent in the field.
Unfortunately, it seems that it was the code world for 


secret agent in the field, the signal for 


to do every nefarious action that they had been planted years ago to
perform. All over town, people we thought of as friends and family
revealed themselves to be carefully planted agents.

Adam
Bayer, weekday shift manager at the Ralph’s, grabbed a discount soup
display and carried it to an unmarked van that had been sitting in
the parking lot as long as anyone could remember, and then drove
wildly away.

Hundreds
of bushes and trees leapt into action, revealing themselves to be
suit-and-sunglass wearing agents in disguise, using clever costumes
that fooled all of us for years – such as holding a hand-written sign
that says “I am a tree.”

Larry
Leroy, out on the edge of town, lit his refrigerator on fire, but he
said that wasn’t because of any secret agent stuff, he just wanted to
do that. Someone had suggested it to him once, although he could not
remember who.

In
fact, it seems that every single person in Night Vale was actually a
secret agent waiting to be activated. We had all been implanted with
the exact same code phrase, which is the kind of sloppy organization
that is just what our government is coming to.

Or…whatever.

And
such.

You
know, look. Honestly, my heart isn’t in this reporting. Blah, blah,
everyone we’ve ever known is secretly an agent. But…here I am,
listeners, secretly a hero. Secret even from myself! It was not
Hector who saved Dana, but me. Me, acting without memory or agency.
What…what is happening to me? How do I not remember something so
huge?

I…I
need to talk to Carlos. Perhaps science can help me. Science so
rarely applies to the real world, but once in a while it provides a
nice metaphor or turn of phrase that makes you think about real
things differently. I’m…I’m hoping Carlos can do that for me.

Now
that everyone has been activated as a secret agent, and did the one
thing they were secretly supposed to do for years, everyone has just
gone right back to doing what they had been doing before. Everything
is back to normal, except that we all know we are all secretly
undercover planted agents here to spy on each other and since we all
know it, we are no longer secret agents. We are just ourselves,
secretly.

Listen,
I know it’s confusing. But I didn’t invent logic. Our
extraterrestrial ancestors did.

Stay
tuned next for all the air being sucked out of the room you’re in,
we’re sorry, we’re so sorry, but this is the only way.

Goodnight,
Night Vale. Goodnight.
